# My VitePress Project

This project is a documentation site built with VitePress, a simple and performant static site generator powered by Vue 3 and Vite.

## Why VitePress??

VitePress is a modern alternative to legacy CMS software like Joomla and WordPress. It offers several advantages, such as:

- Fast development experience with hot module replacement (HMR) and on-demand compilation
- Optimized production build with code splitting and pre-rendering
- Built-in customizable components for common documentation features like navbar, sidebar, and search
- Support for Markdown syntax with Vue components and custom directives
- Support for internationalization (i18n) and theming
- TypeScript support
- And it like actually works, unlike some other content management systems I could mention...

Ok bye.
